# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first blog post using **MDX** and **Next.js**. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you all.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

### Why I chose MDX

Here are some reasons why I chose MDX for my blog:

1. **Component flexibility** - I can use React components in my content
2. **Markdown simplicity** - Writing in markdown is fast and intuitive
3. **Code highlighting** - Perfect for sharing code snippets
4. **Extended features** - Tables, task lists, and other GitHub-flavored markdown features

## Code Examples

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
// Output: Hello, World!
```

And some CSS:

```css
.blog-content {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 2rem;
  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.6;
}
```

## Tables

| Feature     | Supported | Notes                      |
| ----------- | :-------: | -------------------------- |
| Paragraphs  |    ✅     | Basic markdown feature     |
| Headings    |    ✅     | H1 through H6              |
| Lists       |    ✅     | Ordered and unordered      |
| Code blocks |    ✅     | With syntax highlighting   |
| Tables      |    ✅     | Part of GitHub-flavored MD |
| Footnotes   |    ✅     | Using remark plugins       |
